# Control OBS through the command line

Simple Go program (compiles easily on all platforms) to control OBS.

Right now, supports:

```
obs-ws-cmd /scene=My Scene
obs-ws-cmd /vol=Audio Device,0.15
```

A few lines add new commands.

# Install

```
go get github.com/abourget/obs-ws-cmd
```

or request Releases to be produced in an Issue, I'll do my best :)
